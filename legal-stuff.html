            <h1>Legal Stuff</h1>
            <br><br>
            <p>This is all the legal stuff you probably want to know.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h3><i>Table of Contents:</i></h3>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>§I: <a href="#i">Privacy</a></li>
                <li>§II: <a href="#ii">Terms</a></li>
                <li>§III: <a href="#iii">Refunds</a></li>
                <li>§IV: <a href="#iv">Disclaimers & Restrictions</a></li>
                <li>§V: <a href="#v">Changes & Contact</a></li>
            </ul>
            <br><br>
            <h3 id="i"><i>§I: Privacy</i></h3>
            <br>
            <p>First and foremost, I DO NOT collect any of your data that isn't directly provided to me by you. I DO NOT use cookies or any other similar data tracking, collection, or storing technology. I will NEVER keep your data for a longer period of time than what is required to address your inquiry. All data I do retain is stored within <a href="https://google.com/" target="_blank">Google</a>'s mail client. And I will NEVER, under any circumstance, share with, sell to, or otherwise distribute your data to any 3rd party without your explicit consent, or unless required by law or for legal reasons.</p>
            <br>
            <p>This may not, however, apply to the 3rd-party services I utilize, including, but not limited to, <a href="https://formsubmit.co/" target="_blank">FormSubmit</a>, the service I use to receive messages from my contact form; <a href="https://google.com/" target="_blank">Google</a>, whose mail client I use to view and respond to received messages; and <a href="https://payhip.com/" target="_blank">PayHip</a>, whose services I use to host my shop, process payments, and digital product deliveries. I highly advise going through each of their respective legal documents before interacting with their services. The same applies for 3rd parties I link to, embed, quote, excerpt from, promote, or otherwise share.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h3 id="ii"><i>§II: Terms</i></h3>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>You agree to only download my content from sources I officially reviewed, verified, approved, and promoted.</li>
                <li>You agree that purchasing my content only grants you the license to use the content and not sell, share, transfer, or otherwise distribute it without my prior explicit permission.</li>
                <li>You agree to fully attribute me as the original creator of the content if you choose to quote, excerpt, stream, record, transmit, publish, or similarly use my content, regardless of platform, online or otherwise.</li>
                <li>You agree to not use my content in any malicious or otherwise unlawful way.</li>
                <li>You agree to indemnify me if your use of my content causes issues, damages, and/or additional costs for me.</li>
                <li>You agree to, in the event of any disputes, attempt to settle the dispute amicably. In the event of that failing, you agree to settle the dispute according to Croatia's laws, statutes, and judiciary system.</li>
            </ul>
            <br><br>
            <h3 id="iii"><i>§III: Refunds</i></h3>
            <br>
            <p>To request a refund, make sure the following conditions apply to your case:</p>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>You requested the refund within 5 business days from making the purchase.</li>
                <li>You DID NOT download the purchased content beforehand.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>If those two (2) conditions are met, you may send your request through my <a href="contact-me#form">contact form</a>.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h3 id="iv"><i>§IV: Disclaimers & Restrictions</i></h3>
            <br>
            <p>All content is supplied to you 'as is,' without warranty or guarantee of any kind, and I am not responsible for any loss, direct, indirect, or consequential, or other issues or damages you may suffer as a result of purchasing, downloading, otherwise acquiring, relying on, using, or otherwise interacting with my content in any way.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The only safe, legal, and legitimate way of purchasing, downloading, or otherwise acquiring my content is through sources I officially reviewed, verified, approved, and promoted. As such, I hold no responsibility for any loss, direct, indirect, or consequential, or other issues or damages you may suffer as a result of purchasing, downloading, or otherwise acquiring my content from unverified, illegal, or illicit sources.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In case the content I provide, partially or in full, is inappropriate for certain age groups, a notice about that can be found on the content's dedicated store page. Proceeding beyond that notice transfers all responsibility to the person in question. Additionally, I interact with everyone under the assumption that they are an adult. If that is not the case, I expect the person to inform me, if relevant, for I will never personally inquire about such information. Failure to do so transfers all responsibility to the person in question.</p>
            <br>
            <p>And I am not responsible for any outcomes that come as a result of unforeseeable circumstances and/or circumstances that are out of my control, such as natural disasters, wars, third-party issues, power outages, government bans and/or restrictions, &c.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Finally, if any provision of these terms is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions continue in full effect.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h3 id="v"><i>§V: Changes & Contact</i></h3>
            <br>
            <p>I may occasionally change and/or update this document, and since I can't contact you directly about these changes, for I don't store your data beyond your inquiry's resolution, I highly advise checking in on this document on a regular basis to stay informed of any changes to this document.</p>
            <br>
            <p>For contact purposes, I am available via my <a href="contact-me#form">contact form</a> or through email: robert.mail.736@gmail.com.</p>
