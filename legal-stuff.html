            <h3 id="data">§ I: Data & Privacy</h3>
            <br>
            <p>First and foremost, I don't collect any data except the one provided by you through <a href="contact-me">this form</a> or when you reach out to me by email. Additionally, I don't use cookies or any other kind of data collection and/or storage technology.</p>
            <br>
            <p>As for data retention, I, personally, only keep your data until your inquiry has been addressed <a href="#footnote">(*)</a>.</p>
            <br>
            <p>This may not, however, apply to <a href="https://formsubmit.co/" target="_blank">FormSubmit</a>, whose service I use to receive your message(s); <a href="https://google.com/" target="_blank">Google</a>, whose mail client I use to view and respond to your message(s); <a href="https://payhip.com/" target="_blank">Payhip</a>, whose shop service I use to process payments and deliver products; and similar. I highly advise going through their legal documents in order to learn how they handle your data.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Additionally, I may occasionally feature links, embeds, or the like of some third-party services, such as <a href="https://youtube.com/" target="_blank">YouTube</a>, <a href="https://tiktok.com/" target="_blank">TikTok</a>, <a href="https://bsky.social/" target="_blank">Bluesky</a>, &c. As such, I highly advise, again, going through their legal documents to learn how they specifically handle your data.</p>
            <br>
            <p>And I will never, under any circumstance, share your data with any third parties, except when required by law or for legal reasons.</p>
            <br>
            <p id="footnote">(*) If you are using me as a publisher of your work, I retain your name or username, per your preference, which can be found on your work's dedicated page, alongside your email, which is privately kept in my Google mail client. In this case, your data is stored indefinitely or until you request the content to be removed. The reason behind this is so the other users know exactly who made the content, and so they can adequately attribute it to you. And your email is stored so that I can contact you in the future.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h3 id="terms">§ II: Terms & End User</h3>
            <br>
            <p>By accessing any of the projects, products, services, and/or the like on this website, you agree to comply with and be bound by these terms.</p>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>You agree to only download content from this website and/or my verified distributors.</li>
                <li>You agree to the fact that purchasing content in my <a href="shop">Shop</a> only grants you the license to use the content, not sell, share, transfer, or otherwise distribute it without my or the original content's creator's explicit permission.</li>
                <li>You agree to comply with my refund policy, which states that if you wish to refund your purchase, you must request a refund within 5 business days from making the purchase, as well as NOT download the file(s) beforehand.</li>
                <li>You agree to fully attribute the original content's creator if you quote, excerpt, stream, broadcast, record, transmit, publish, &c., yourself and/or through others using the purchased content, whether it be through digital platforms or in person.</li>
                <li>You agree to not use the content in any unlawful or malicious way and/or use the content for that/those purpose(s).</li>
                <li>You agree that if you set the "Eligible for Charity" tag to ON for your work published in my <a href="shop">Shop</a>, 50% of your profit will go towards charity.</li>
                <li>You agree that if you use my <a href="shop">Shop</a> to publish your work, I retain your name or username, per your preference, which is publicly visible, as well as your email, which is privately kept in my Google mail client. This information is kept indefinitely or until you choose to remove your work from my <a href="shop">Shop</a> <a href="#footnote">(*)</a>.</li>
                <li>You agree that if you use my <a href="shop">Shop</a> to publish your work, I will take a 10% cut out of your revenue, with the exception of if you set up your own checkout system, in which case you will be responsible for all VAT and/or other tax-related deductions or additions to price.</li>
                <li>You agree that if you use my <a href="shop">Shop</a> to publish your work, it is your sole responsibility to ensure your content complies with relevant laws and/or regulations. If I find out about any offenses, I will remove that content and may additionally submit a report to relevant authorities, depending on the severity.</li>
                <li>You agree to indemnify me if your misuse of the content found within my <a href="shop">Shop</a> causes issues, legal or otherwise, damages, and/or additional costs for me.</li>
            </ul>
            <br><br>
            <h3 id="owner">§ III: Ownership & Licensing</h3>
            <br>
            <p>All content I provide is the property of its rightful creator, whose name or username can be found on their content's dedicated page. This means the creator retains all rights to the content and has full control to add, modify, or delete it at any time. The only exception to this is if the content is required by law or for legal reasons.</p>
            <br>
            <p>To publish new content or manage your existing content, <a href="contact-me">contact me</a>.</p>
            <br>
            <p>And if you are the rightful owner who found your content being distributed by me without your permission, contact me through <a href="contact-me">this form</a>, explain your situation, and prove your ownership and lack of permission, after which the content will be removed.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h3 id="age">§ IV: Age Restrictions</h3>
            <br>
            <p>In case the content I provide features content inappropriate for certain age groups, a notice about that can be found on the content's dedicated page. Proceeding beyond that notice carries over all responsibility to the person in question.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I interact with all users under the assumption that they are adults. If that is not the case, I expect the user to inform me, for I will never personally request that information. Failure to do so transfers all responsibility to the person in question.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h3 id="disputes">§ V: Disclaimers, Disputes & Liability</h3>
            <br>
            <p>All content is supplied to you 'as is,' without warranty or guarantee of any kind (express, spoken, or implied), and I am not responsible for any loss, direct, indirect, consequential, or other issues or damages you may suffer from purchasing, downloading, relying on, and/or using this content in any way.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The only safe, legal, and legitimate way to acquire this content is through me and my verified distributors. As such, I hold no responsibility if any issues arise from acquiring this content from shady, suspicious, illegal, or illicit sources.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I aim to resolve all disputes in a fair and amicable way; however, if any issues do arise, they will be settled according to Croatia's laws, statutes, and judiciary system. Additionally, this document is governed by Croatian laws, and we both agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Croatian courts in the event of any disputes.</p>
            <br>
            <p>And I am not responsible for any outcomes that come as a result of unforeseeable circumstances and/or circumstances that are out of my control, such as natural disasters, wars, third-party service and/or server outages, power outages, government bans and/or restrictions, &c.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Finally, If any provision of these terms is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions continue in full effect.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h3 id="changes">§ VI: Changes & Contact</h3>
            <br>
            <p>I may occasionally change and/or update this document, so I advise regularly overviewing this document for any changes that may concern you. I cannot contact you about these changes, as I do not store your information over long periods of time <a href="#footnote">(*)</a>.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In case you want to contact me, you can do so through <a href="contact-me">this form</a> or <span class="warning">robert.rndm.fg@gmail.com</span>.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Finally, more detailed and/or specific information, such as the publishing process, how to make purchases, how to request refunds, why, &c., can be found in my <a href="contact-me#faq">FAQ</a>.</p>
