            <h1>Projects</h1>
            <br><br>
            <p>Here is a list of all the things I've made, worked on, or maintained that I find interesting enough to showcase!</p>
            <br><br>
            <h3><a href="https://corneliusatweb.com/">>> corneliusatweb.com</a></h3>
            <br>
            <p>This is my personal website. You are here. I built this site with HTML and CSS, alongside some minor JavaScript. Here I document my projects and host my blog! In general, I've been fiddling around with web development for roughly the last 5 years.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h3><a href="shop/id/S7QubDZU2x/">>> 'Book'</a></h3>
            <br>
            <p>(*) I'm yet to decide on a name for my book.</p>
            <br>
            <p>For the longest time, I've been a fan of the American Wild West period. After soaking up plenty of inspiration from books, movies, and video games, I decided to set forth and write my own frontier adventure. My story follows Henry Smith, a Civil War soldier looking for peace after the war, accidentally getting himself involved in a feud between Cillian Finley and Aidan O'Connor.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h3><a href="shop/id/h9uiyYEkI6/">>> 1863</a></h3>
            <br>
            <p>Alongside writing a book, I also always wanted to make a game. Over the years, I have played around in many a game engine, everything from Unreal Engine to CryEngine, but I ultimately settled on Godot. My game is set in an alternate universe where the United States of America merged with the United Kingdom (alongside all their territories, colonies, &c.) to form the State in 1863. The exact time in which my game itself is set specifically is not defined; however, you do assume the role of a Colonel tasked with defeating the State's enemies no matter the cost. It will be a relatively simple 2D top-down strategy game.</p>
            <br><br>
            <p>(*) There has been plenty of other stuff in the past 5 years, but I sadly forgot most of it. ;(</p>
