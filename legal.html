            <h3 id="data">§ I: Data & Privacy</h3>
            <br>
            <p>First and foremost, I don't collect any data except the one provided by you through <a href="contact-me">this form</a> or when you reach out to me by email. Additionally, I don't use cookies or any other kind of data collection and/or storage technology.</p>
            <br>
            <p>As for data retention, I, personally, only keep your data until your inquiry has been addressed <a href="#footnote">(*)</a>. This may not, however, apply to <a href="https://formsubmit.co/" target="_blank">FormSubmit</a>, whose service I use to receive your message(s), and <a href="https://google.com/" target="_blank">Google</a>, whose mail client I use to view and respond to your message(s). I highly advise going through their legal documents in order to learn how they handle your data.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Additionally, I may occasionally feature links, embeds, or the like of some third-party services, such as <a href="https://youtube.com/" target="_blank">YouTube</a>, <a href="https://tiktok.com/" target="_blank">TikTok</a>, <a href="https://bsky.social/" target="_blank">Bluesky</a>, &c. As such, I highly advise, again, going through their legal documents to learn how they specifically handle your data.</p>
            <br>
            <p>And I will never, under any circumstance, share your data with any third parties, except when required by law or for legal reasons.</p>
            <br>
            <p id="footnote">(*) If you are using me as a publisher of your work, I retain your name or username, per your preference, which can be found on your work's dedicated page, alongside your email, which is privately kept in my Google mail client. In this case, your data is stored indefinitely or until you request the content to be removed. The reason behind this is so the other users know exactly who made the content they are looking at, and so they can adequately attribute it to you.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h3 id="terms">§ II: Terms & End User</h3>
            <br>
            <p>By accessing any of my projects, products, services, and/or the like, you agree to comply with and be bound by these terms.</p>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>You agree to only download my products from my website or my verified distributors.</li>
                <li>You agree to the fact that purchasing content in my Shop only grants you the license to use the content, not sell, share, transfer, or otherwise distribute it without my or the original content's creator's explicit permission.</li>
                <li>You agree to comply with my refund policy, which states that if you wish to refund your purchase, you must request a refund within 5 business days from making the purchase, as well as NOT download the file(s) beforehand.</li>
                <li>You agree to fully attribute the original content's creator if you quote, excerpt, stream, broadcast, record, transmit, publish, &c., yourself and/or through others using the purchased content, whether it be through digital platforms or in person.</li>
                <li>You agree to not use the content in any unlawful or malicious way and/or use the content for that/those purpose(s).</li>
            </ul>
            <br><br>
            <h3 id="owner">§ III: Ownership & Licensing</h3>
            <br>
            <p>All content I provide is the property of its rightful creator, whose name or username can be found on their content's dedicated page. This means the creator retains all rights to the content and has full control to add, modify, or delete it at any time. The only exception to this is if the content is required by law or for legal reasons.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Regarding <a href="downloads">Downloads</a>, there are three (3) licenses to keep in mind.</p>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Free</b> — You can use the content for any purpose, commercial or otherwise, however you want.</li>
                <li><b>Attribution</b> — Same as <b>Free</b>; however, you must attribute me as the creator of the original material.</li>
                <li><b>Restricted</b> — Same as <b>Attribution</b>, but you CANNOT use the material for commercial purposes.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>You can find which license is applied to which item on the item's dedicated page. Regardless of the license applied, you are forbidden from distributing or selling this content as a standalone product, with or without my attribution.</p>
            <br>
            <p>And if you are the rightful owner who found your content being distributed by me without your permission, contact me through <a href="contact-me">this form</a>, explain your situation, and prove your ownership and lack of permission, after which the content will be removed.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h3 id="age">§ IV: Age Restrictions</h3>
            <br>
            <p>In case the content I provide features content inappropriate for certain age groups, a notice about that can be found on the content's dedicated page. Proceeding beyond that notice carries over all responsibility to the person in question.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I interact with all users under the assumption that they are adults. If that is not the case, I expect the user to inform me, for I will never personally request that information. Failure to do so transfers all responsibility to the person in question.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h3 id="disputes">§ V: Disclaimers, Disputes & Liability</h3>
            <br>
            <p>All content is supplied to you 'as is,' without warranty or guarantee of any kind (express, spoken, or implied), and I am not responsible for any loss, direct, indirect, consequential, or other issues or damages you may suffer from purchasing, downloading, relying on, and/or using my content in any way.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The only safe, legal, and legitimate way to acquire my content is through me and my verified distributors. As such, I hold no responsibility if any issues arise from acquiring my content from shady, suspicious, illegal, or illicit sources.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I aim to resolve all disputes in a fair and amicable way; however, if any issues do arise, they will be settled according to Croatia's laws, statutes, and judiciary system. Additionally, this document is governed by Croatian laws, and we both agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Croatian courts in the event of any disputes.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Finally, I am not responsible for any outcomes that come as a result of unforeseeable circumstances and/or circumstances that are out of my control, such as natural disasters, wars, third-party service and/or server outages, government restrictions, &c.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h3 id="changes">§ VI: Changes & Contact</h3>
            <br>
            <p>I may occasionally change and/or update this document, so I advise regularly overviewing this document for any changes that may concern you. I cannot contact you about these changes, as I do not store your information over long periods of time <a href="#footnote">(*)</a>.</p>
