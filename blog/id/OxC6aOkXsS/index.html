            <p>Posted: 06/Nov/2025 • Updated: N/A</p>
            <br><hr><br>
            <p>Hello, everyone!</p>
            <br>
            <p>Since this is my first blog post, I wanted to take this one-of-a-kind special opportunity to introduce the blog itself, my website in general, what I do, what I offer, what I'm currently working on, and more... So, without further ado, let's begin!</p>
            <br>
            <p>First and foremost, the blog itself. You can think of this blog as a hub for all my thoughts, projects, ideas, and really anything else I feel like writing. I might also sometimes post scripts I wrote for my YouTube videos, because why not?</p>
            <br>
            <p>Next up, this website. Ever since I started developing websites, as far back as when I used online website builders, I wanted to have a website of my own; however, I could never settle on what I wanted my website to be used for and how I wanted it to look. That led me on what can easily be described as a rabbit hole of countless rebuilds and reworks every few weeks for the past few years at the very least. Finally, I settled on this design, which I am both happy with and hope will remain for the foreseeable future. As for the purpose of this website, I mainly use it to host my social links and various projects and files, as well as sell my stuff here, which I prefer doing myself, as it offers me full control over my <a href="../../../shop" target="_blank">Shop</a>. I also use it to host this very blog (duh), alongside my contact information. I primarily used native HTML and CSS to make the website, with some touches of JavaScript.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I personally have a lot of different interests and hobbies, but my primary ones are gaming, web development, history, nature, and writing, with some other minor ones, such as art and space. My current list of projects as of writing this post includes this website, my video game (1863), which I'm making in Godot, and my book, which I'm still yet to decide a name for, which will also take place in the 1860s-1870s. All of these projects will eventually be available in my <a href="../../../shop" target="_blank">Shop</a>.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Since it doesn't really make a whole lot of sense to host an entire Shop page just for my own projects, I decided to also implement a publishing service. Basically, if you are a creator and want a simple place to sell your stuff, you can do so in my Shop under the agreement that I get to take a 10% cut off of the revenue. Alternatively, you can also set up your own payment method and only use my Shop as a hub for your work, in which case no cuts are applied. You can learn more about the specific process by visiting my <a href="../../../contact-me" target="_blank">FAQ</a> and scrolling down near the end, where I provide a specific example and more information on how the entire process works, including how you can submit your work to be published in my Shop in the first place.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Finally, a quick first update on my Icelandic learning journey. As of this month, I started using the <a href="https://icelandiconline.com/" target="_blank">Icelandic Online</a> platform to learn the language. Alongside that, I'm making physical notes of the words I go over and their translations, which helps me learn grammar and spelling. Finally, I'm using <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/" target="_blank">Anki</a> to practice vocabulary. So far, I've learned some 250 words, give or take. Since the language is pretty hard, it will take a very long time to actually learn it to a level at which I'd be comfortable using the language (let's say some B2 level on the CEFR scale), but since I find the language quite interesting, I'm sure I'll get there eventually!</p>

            <div class="card">
                <p><i>Sæl, ég heiti er Cornelius! Ég tala Ensku, Króatísku, og smá Íslensku, en ég er enn að læra. Flott að sjá þú; bless og sjáumst!</i></p>
                <h5>Hello, my name is Cornelius! I speak English, Croatian, and some Icelandic, but I'm still learning. Great to see you; bye and cya later!</h5>
            </div>
            <br>
            <p>And with that, this quick blog post comes to an end. I'll aim to post here as frequently as possible, as long as it's interesting!</p>
            <br>
            <p>Until next time, cheers! :3</p>
