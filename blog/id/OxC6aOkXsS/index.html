            <h2>Me, New Blog, Icelandic #1, and more?</h2>
            <p>Updated: 07/Dec/2025</p>
            <br><br>
            <p>Hi,</p>
            <br>
            <p>Welcome to my blog! Even though this is technically the first post here, I've modified it significantly since it was originally posted, but the core idea is still here: introduce the new blog and talk about my interests and my Icelandic learning journey. So, without further ado, let's begin!</p>
            <br>
            <p>So, first things first, this blog. Here, I'll basically write about whatever subject I'm currently hyperfixated on, whether it be games, history, nature, Iceland and its language, or something entirely different. I generally don't chase trends, so don't expect that kind of stuff here.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I'm primarily interested in web development, game development, video games (my fav is probably Frostpunk :D), and history, but I also like nature and space. I started web development around 2020 and game development even earlier than that, around 2019. Currently, I'm making websites with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while my game is being made in Godot. I'm also writing my own novel, set in 1860s America, following the story of Henry Smith, a Civil War volunteer, trying to find peace after the war, just to end up in a feud between Cillian Finley and Aidan O'Connor.</p>
            <br>
            <p>And now, finally, onto the Icelandic update. Since I only started a month ago, I'm still pretty new, probably around A1+. I can have basic conversations, orient myself, and describe where something is or who someone is, as well as read and write basic sentences, but I can't really discuss more complicated matters, such as politics, religion, history, &c.; those are reserved for the B2-C2 range. For learning new words, sentences, and practice, I'm using <a href="https://icelandiconline.com/" target="_blank">Icelandic Online</a>, after which I write down all new words and their translations, as well as sentence practice, in my physical notebook, since I think writing something down physically helps me remember better than if I were writing the same on a keyboard. Finally, I'm using <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/" target="_blank">Anki</a> to practice memory and sentence construction. I also practice speaking throughout the day!</p>
            <br>
            <div class="card">
                <p>Sæl, ég heiti Cornelius. Ég er frá Króatíu, en ég enn tala Ensku og ætla að læra Íslensku!</p>
                <h5>Hello, my name is Cornelius. I am from Croatia, but I also speak English, and I want to learn Icelandic!</h5>

            <p>With that, I bid you all adieu until next time! :3</p>
