            <p>Hello, everyone!</p>
            <br>
            <p>Since this is my first blog post, I wanted to take this one-of-a-kind special opportunity to yap a bit about myself!</p>
            <br>
            <p>First and foremost, the blog itself. Here I'll write about whatever I'm hyperfixated on at the moment.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Ever since I started creating websites, as far back as when I used online website builders, I wanted to have a website of my own; however, I could never settle on what I wanted my website to be used for and how I wanted it to look. That led me on what can easily be described as a rabbit hole of countless rebuilds and reworks every few weeks for the past few years at the very least. Finally, I settled on this design, which I am both happy with and hope will remain for the foreseeable future. That is not to say all those other renditions of my past websites were all for nothing; quite the contrary, as with each one I learned something I didn't know before and slowly honed my preferences to what they are today. I primarily used native HTML and CSS to make the website, with some touches of JavaScript.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I have a lot of different interests and hobbies, but my primary ones, alongside the aforementioned, are gaming (as of writing: Grayzone Warfare, Sons of the Forest, Minecraft, and Resident Evil 7), history (primarily the American Civil War, the American Revolution, and human evolution), nature, and writing (I'm writing a book for which I'm yet to decide a title), with some other minor ones, such as art and space.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Finally, a quick first update on my Icelandic learning journey. As of this month, I started using the <a href="https://icelandiconline.com/" target="_blank">Icelandic Online</a> platform to learn the language. Alongside that, I'm making physical notes of the words I go over and their translations, which helps me learn grammar and spelling. Finally, I'm using <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/" target="_blank">Anki</a> to practice vocabulary (*). Since the language is pretty hard, it will take a very long time to actually learn it to a level at which I'd be comfortable using the language, but since I find the language quite interesting, I'm sure I'll get there eventually!</p>
            <br>
            <div class="card">
                <p><i>Sæl, ég heiti er Cornelius! Ég tala Ensku, Króatísku og smá Íslensku, en ég er enn að læra. Flott að sjá þú; bless og sjáumst!</i></p>
                <h5>Hello, my name is Cornelius! I speak English, Croatian, and some Icelandic, but I'm still learning. Great to see you; bye and cya later!</h5>
            </div>
            <br>
            <p>(*) Since I initially wrote this post, I made the decision to drop Anki. Primarily because creating new entries and organizing them every time I learned a few new words became really tedious. There are also certain limitations I really didn't like, such as not allowing duplicate cards, even across several decks and not just within a single deck. So when a single English word has several translations in Icelandic ("They" = "Þeir," "Þær," or "Þau," depending on gender), I have to add specific context or gender next to each English word, even if they are in entirely different decks. I'm sure there's probably some way to configure the app for this to not be an issue, but, for what it's worth, my physical notebook already does exactly what Anki did, so, honestly, I really didn't benefit much from Anki in the first place.</p>
            <br>
            <p>And with that, this quick blog post comes to an end. I'll aim to post here as frequently as possible, as long as it's interesting!</p>
            <br>
            <p>Until next time, cheers! :3</p>
