            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <br><br>
            <p>Hi,</p>
            <br>
            <p>I'm Cornelius. You are on my website. And this is my expository page!</p>
            <br>
            <p>First and foremost, why the name "Cornelius"? Mainly, it has a certain charm and a ring to it that make it distinct from today's either overly basic or overly edgy nicknames. I'm not saying anything's wrong with choosing the aforementioned two; I just like mine more! :D But, also, since I am a history lover and religion is part of history after all, I chose the name Cornelius, as that was the name of the Roman centurion who became the first Gentile to convert to Christianity.</p>
            <br>
            <div class="card">
                <p><i>At Caesarea, there was a man named Cornelius, a centurion in what was known as the Italian Regiment. He and all his family were devout and God-fearing; he gave generously to those in need and prayed to God regularly. One day at about three in the afternoon, he had a vision. He distinctly saw an angel of God, who came to him and said, "Cornelius!"</i></p>
                <div class="right">
                    <h5>— Acts 10, NIV; <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2010&version=NIV" target="_blank">Learn more</a></h5>
                </div>
            </div>
            <br>
            <p>But enough about my name; now, let's learn a bit about me! I am natively from Croatia; however, I'm also fluent in English, and currently, I'm also learning Icelandic. Why? Well, I want to visit Iceland one day and be able to speak the language, at least at an advanced conversational level, but I also find the language itself very cool!</p>
            <br>
            <p>Ever since I learned about web development, I wanted to have a website of my own. First, I started with simple website builders, but one day I discovered HTML and CSS. At first, it was just a simple experiment, but soon I'd fall in love with the two, and here I am today. Along the journey, I also started using JavaScript, but to a lesser extent, as I never really was all that interested in learning it, and neither am I now. If I need to do something with it, I can pull it off using online resources, but I'll avoid it if I can.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Another hobby of mine is game development. I've tried everything from Unreal Engine to CryEngine; however, I ultimately settled on Godot for my first serious game, called "1863." It's a simple 2D strategy game with a twist: you don't issue commands by clicking on pop-ups or dragging troops around; no, you issue commands by typing them in the command terminal, and the map is just a simple paper map of the battlefield with a marker, so you can take notes of whatever you think is important to remember. I think that this, if executed properly, has the potential to really differentiate my game from other similar titles and add a unique challenge to it. Not to mention the unintentional difficulty, which stems from how much info you choose to write down and how much you choose to remember, so you can define your own custom difficulty.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I also occasionally do simple art, which you can find on my <a href="https://corneliusatweb.com/">social media</a>, particularly <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/cornelius-at.bsky.social" target="_blank">Bluesky</a>.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Oh, and I almost forgot! I'm also writing my own book set in 1860s America, specifically the Territory of Montana. I won't go too in-depth with this one to not spoil it, but the core concept follows Henry Smith, a Civil War volunteer, looking for peace after the war, coincidentally stumbling upon a feud between Cillian Finley and Aidan O'Connor.</p>
            <br>
            <p>And finally, my other interests include gaming, nature, space, and many more (I sort of pick them up like dirt on my shoes).</p>
