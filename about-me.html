            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <br>
            <p>Hi, and welcome to my website. Online, I go by the name of <b>Cornelius</b>, and this is my own little expository page.</p>
            <br>
            <p>To begin with, what is the reason behind me choosing the name <b>Cornelius</b>? Primarily, the name is <u>cool</u>, but also, Biblically, Cornelius was a Roman centurion and one of the first Gentiles to convert to Christianity. Although I'm not a Christian myself, I am a history lover, and religion is part of history, so I am, naturally, drawn to and fascinated by it.</p>
            <br>
            <div class="card">
                <p><i>At Caesarea, there was a man named Cornelius, a centurion in what was known as the Italian Regiment. He and all his family were devout and God-fearing; he gave generously to those in need and prayed to God regularly.</i></p>

            </div>
            <br>
            <p>I am natively from (&#x1f1ed;&#x1f1f7;) Croatia, but I can also understand, speak, read, and write in English (I assume around C1+ on the CEFR scale), and I am currently learning (&#x1f1ee;&#x1f1f8;) Icelandic, primarily because I find the language itself very interesting.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Ever since I had my first phone, I have been interested in games, apps, software, and how all three are developed. When I got my computer in 2018, which I still use today (though significantly upgraded), I started experimenting with creating video games in Roblox Studio and various online website builders. Sometime between 2020 and 2021, I decided to dip my fingers in web development with HTML, CSS, and partially JavaScript. Initially, it was just a small experiment to check it out, but little did I know that I'd fall in love with the hobby and would be doing it to this day. I personally consider myself an expert in both HTML and CSS, though I obviously don't know everything, and an amateur with JavaScript; when something needs to be done in JavaScript, I can pull it off with the help of online resources, but it never really interested me enough to actually learn it.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Since, I also started fiddling around with various game engines, from Unreal Engine and CryEngine to Godot, which is the engine I'm currently making my game (1863) in. 1863 is, as the name suggests, set in 1863, during the American Civil War, where you, the player, assume the role of a Colonel in the fictional State's army, and you are tasked with defeating the enemy by any means necessary. It's a simple strategy game that you can purchase <a href="shop/id/h9uiyYEkI6/">here</a> if you want to check it out.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I also do art and like to occasionally draw stuff in my free time (though I'm pretty bad lol). The software I use for my art is Krita paired with the Wacom Intuos BT M, which is a relatively budget-friendly drawing tablet. Below you can see some of my art.</p>
            <br>

            <p>You can find my other art on my <a href="https://corneliusatweb.com/">social media</a>.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Finally, I am also currently writing my own book. It will be a novel set in the 1865 Territory of Montana. Obviously, I don't want to spoil too much about the actual contents just yet. My other interests include nature, space, and many others.</p>
            <br>
            <p>If you want to see a list of all my projects, you can visit the <a href="projects">Projects</a> page, and if you want to contact me, you can do so through the <a href="contact-me">Contact Me</a> form found on the page of the same name! I hope this essay wasn't too boring, and, until next time, cheers!</p>
